# Review and reproduction of kaggle solutions 

Goals:
>1. modularize the code for future reuse.
>2. optimize the memory consumption so it can run on an average machine.
>3. I'll also share some btb code.

Instructions and requirements can be found in comps/comp_xxx/sol_xx. If not, the solution is not ready yet.
